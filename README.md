# D3QN RL Autonomous Cars 

Hello! To install, make sure you have **UNITY 2019.4** as this was the version I created the AI's environment in. Other packages you need to install are: **pytorch and numpy**. Make sure to have **socket** installed too, but this should be installed already.

Make sure to follow my GitHub and **star** this repository if you found it useful! Thanks!
